Rating: 5.0 out of 5 stars
Title: .0 out of 5 stars Sweet and charming and queer!
Date: Reviewed in the United States on March 27, 2022
Review: ‚ÄúAnd I can honestly say I have never looked at Charles and imagined how his lips would feel. Do people really look at someone‚Äôs lips and think of such things? I suppose some people must or we would never have started it up in the first place. At any rate, if it had been up to me, kissing would likely have never been discovered.‚Äù‚Å£
‚Å£
Imagine your favorite, charming, sweet, closed door, Regency romance but seamlessly filled with queer characters and magical spell casting and you‚Äôll have an idea about this book. ‚Å£
‚Å£
In this epistolary Regency romance, everyone has a persuasion and you might like gentlemen or ladies or both or neither. And it‚Äôs not secret or hidden or taboo or anything negative at all. It just is what it is. ‚Å£
‚Å£
And the friends to lovers trope between Charles and Gavin is sweet and satisfying. I love how patient Charles is with Gavin‚Äôs reluctance to give in to romance. And Gavin‚Äôs pushy sister Gerry is a delight. This is the first in a historical fantasy series called Meddle & Mend and I hope the next book is about her! ‚Å£

Title: .0 out of 5 stars HEA in a very different Regency romance
Date: Reviewed in the United States on June 20, 2022
Review: I've been reading Regency romances for 60+ years, and I thought I knew everything that authors would throw at me. How very refreshing to find something new. One of the sweetest HEAs I've ever read. I love the world that Ms Wallace has created.
I am not as fond of the Audible narrators. The male in particular sounds far too old for the part, and the frequent odd pauses are distracting and annoying - think exaggerated Captain Kirk!

Review: So so good. I can‚Äôt wait for this author to write more. I loved this book so much. It is subtle and so romantic. It‚Äôs sweet and realistic. I had the chance to finish it while I was in London. And the addresses in the book are real. So good.

Title: .0 out of 5 stars Soft and wonderful series starter!
Date: Reviewed in the United States on June 22, 2023
Review: Despite reading the other books in this series and having met Gavin and Charles, it‚Äôs only now that I‚Äôm going back to the beginning to see how they met and fell in love. Not only was I utterly in love with their story from the first page, I‚Äôm also marvelling at what a smart series starter this is with Sarah Wallace doing an exceptional job at introducing the world.

Written entirely in letters, we see the story primarily through Gavin‚Äôs eyes while he manages family business in London. Introverted and grumpy, Gavin is unenthusiastic about London until he is quickly taken under the wing of Charles Kentworthy who is determined to befriend Gavin and prove to him that London has more to offer. Though very reluctant, Gavin soon comes to care very deeply for his gregarious new friend and the pair fall in love in the sweetest, swooniest way.

I love epistolaries since letters are such an intimate insight into characters‚Äô personalities and thoughts. Wallace incorporates this device so brilliantly and all the characters leap off the page with such clarity. This was also such a smart way to introduce this queer normative and magical fantasy AU that Wallace has built by having Gavin write lengthy letters to his sister, also allowing the reader to experience the fantastic world-building. I also adored how we slowly see Gavin‚Äôs feelings grow for Charles as he wrestles with how he experiences attraction and his insecurities, and it was just so soft and precious to watch him realize how in love he was with his best friend. Their letters to each other run the gamut of sassy banter, serious musings and deep affection, and I couldn't help but squeal out loud at the utter cuteness of these two. This was just the gentlest, softest love story with bi and demi rep and I appreciate the whole series even more after coming back to this first book.

5 magical stars for this wonderful book and I absolutely recommend this joyfully queer love story to everyone!

Review: Gavin is sent to London to take care of some family business. He doesn‚Äôt know anyone there and is rather quiet, shy and introverted. He would much rather stay in the library all day with his books than be a part of London society. After one night out with a little too much to drink, he finds himself with a gambling debt- that was already taken care of by a mysterious stranger. As Gavin apologizes and thanks him for his kindness, they end up writing back and forth and the stranger, Mr. Kentworthy, known to be quite a rake and a socialite, is determined to show Gavin what London is really like and get him out of the library.

I thought this book was adorable! This is a regency era romance where the whole setting was just so warm and cozy, inviting and sweet and I never want to leave! I loved the characters and the fact that the book was written as a series of letters between them all. It made the reading experience seem so much more personal and that the characters were good friends. Once the book was over, I missed them!

This is the first book in the Meddle & Mend series and I can‚Äôt wait to read more! The second book is already published and the third is being released in a few weeks. If you are looking for a sweet, regency era romance, look no further than Letters to Half Moon Street.

I voluntarily reviewed a complimentary copy of this book which I received from the @hazels_booktours and the author. All opinions are my own.
